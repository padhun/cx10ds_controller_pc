The CX10DS is a cheap wifi drone developed by cheerson. 
Product page: http://www.cheersonhobby.com/en-US/Home/ProductDetail/121

Once you connect to the drones wifi AP (ssid is usually CX-10DS-D0SS2S or something like that). 
Check if you can ping the drones IP (192.168.4.1) if you can you are good to go. 
If not try reconnecting maybe turn your drone on and off sometimes it did not connect for me for some strange reason.

Once you can ping it you can start the python script which is a basic application that can do the following.

P - Takeoff

L - Land


W - Throttle ++

S - Throttle --

D - Rudder ++

A - Rudder --


UP_ARROW - Elevator ++

DOWN_ARROW - Elevator -- 

RIGHT_ARROW - Aileron ++

LEFT_ARROW - Aileron --


Enjoy.
